# API Endpoint Fixes

This file documents the changes made to API endpoints in the UI code to match the new API pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. In `gestion-etudiants.html`

- Updated `loadTeacherData()` to fetch teacher sections using `my-sections` endpoint
- Modified `loadStudents()` to use the correct `/id-section/students` API pattern
- Enhanced `populateSectionFilter()` to handle sections data from the API
- Converted function declarations to function expressions to resolve syntax errors

### 2. In `js/teacher-announcements.js`

- Changed `enseignants/sections` to `enseignants/my-sections`
- Updated `sections/${sectionId}/students` to `enseignants/${currentTeacher.id}/sections/${sectionId}/students`
- Changed `groups/${groupId}/students` to `enseignants/${currentTeacher.id}/groups/${groupId}/students`
- Updated `enseignants/groups` to `enseignants/my-groups`
- Changed `etudiants/with-disability` to `enseignants/students-with-disability`
- Added global variable exports for `teacherSections` and `teacherGroups`

### 3. In `js/accessibility-checker.js`

- Updated the API endpoint from `etudiants/with-disability` to `enseignants/students-with-disability`

## Consistency Achieved

The code now consistently uses the following API patterns:

- `/api/enseignants/my-sections` - To get the teacher's sections
- `/api/enseignants/my-groups` - To get the teacher's groups
- `/api/enseignants/:teacherId/sections/:sectionId/students` - To get students in a section
- `/api/enseignants/:teacherId/groups/:groupId/students` - To get students in a group
- `/api/enseignants/students-with-disability` - To get students with disability status

## Next Steps

1. Test the applications with the new API pattern
2. Consider implementing error handling to gracefully handle API changes in the future
3. Document the API patterns for future reference
4. Implement a centralized API client to manage endpoint URLs and authentication
